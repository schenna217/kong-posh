It is a popular dessert made from a combination of ingredients including roasted cashews, ghee (clarified butter), sugar, cardamom, saffron, and sometimes rose water. The roasted cashews are ground to a fine powder and then mixed with ghee, sugar, and aromatic spices to form a dough-like consistency. The mixture is then shaped into small balls or discs and garnished with saffron strands or chopped nuts for added flavor and visual appeal.',
