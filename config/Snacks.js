    description: 'Channa Sabzi, also known as Chana Masala or Chole, is a popular vegetarian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is made using chickpeas, or channa, that are cooked in a flavorful tomato-based gravy. The dish is known for its bold and robust flavors, with a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala that give it a distinct taste profile. The chickpeas are typically cooked until tender, then simmered in the gravy, often made with onions, tomatoes, and a variety of spices. Channa Sabzi is often garnished with fresh cilantro and served with naan bread, roti, or rice.',
